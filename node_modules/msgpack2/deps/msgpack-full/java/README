
To build the JAR file of Message Pack, you need to install Maven (http://maven.apache.org), then type the following command:

$ mvn package

To locally install the project, type
$ mvn install

To generate project files (.project, .classpath) for Eclipse, do 

$ mvn eclipse:eclipse

then import the folder from your Eclipse. 

Next, open the preference page in Eclipse and add the CLASSPATH variable:

M2_REPO = $HOME/.m2/repository

where $HOME is your home directory. In Windows XP, $HOME is:
C:/Documents and Settings/(user name)/.m2/repository 


# How to release the project (compile, test, tagging, deploy)

$ mvn release:prepare
$ mvn release:perform
